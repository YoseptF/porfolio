I'm a full-stack developer, I've been working with JavaScript for over 5 years(P5.js, React.js, ML5), Unity with C# for about 2 years, and now with help from the folks at Microverse, I'm learning the ins and outs of remote working.

I actually studied digital art and a couple of years of philosophy before I became a front-end developer, and I try to apply that in the way I practice programming, I like inserting a little art in every project, make it “a little bit mine”.

My inbox is always open, I love creative projects, so hit me up with an email anytime.

Technical Skills:
JavaScript, React, Firebase, JAMstack, Hugo, forestry, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Git, Heroku, Responsive Design, Photoshop, Unity, Unreal Engine 4.
